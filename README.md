update: in https://arxiv.org/html/2504.09596v1, I listed the ideas worth to try but not yet due to my limited bandwidth in sparse time.

pls feel free to do these experiments to have fun, and pls consider citing the article if it somehow helps in your recsys exploration:

modified based on [paper author's tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec), switching to PyTorch(v1.6) for simplicity, fixed issues like positional embedding usage etc. (making it harder to overfit, except for that, in recsys, personalization=overfitting sometimes)

code in `python` folder.

to train:

```
python main.py --dataset=ml-1m --train_dir=default --maxlen=200 --dropout_rate=0.2 --device=cuda
```

just inference:

```
python main.py --device=cuda --dataset=ml-1m --train_dir=default --state_dict_path='ml-1m_default/SASRec.epoch=1000.lr=0.001.layer=2.head=1.hidden=50.maxlen=200.pth' --inference_only=true --maxlen=200

```

output for each run would be slightly random, as negative samples are randomly sampled, here's my output for two consecutive runs:

```
1st run - test (NDCG@10: 0.5897, HR@10: 0.8190)
2nd run - test (NDCG@10: 0.5918, HR@10: 0.8225)
```

pls check paper author's [repo](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec) for detailed intro and more complete README, and here's the paper bib FYI :)

I see a dozen of citations of the repo recentlyðŸ«°, here's the repo bib if needed.
